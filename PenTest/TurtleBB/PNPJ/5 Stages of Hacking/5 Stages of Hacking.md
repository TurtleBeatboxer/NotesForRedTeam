**Reconnaissance** active is running tools
Passive is learning without interaction

**Scanning** in the scanning stage, we try to actively enumerate or find domains and open ports, services and vulnerabilities. Nmap, sublist3r, subfinder. This step can identify potential weaknesses that  can be exploited

**Gaining Access** in this stage, ethical hacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the target system or network. The focus is on exploiting vulnerabilities discovered before. Techniques such as password cracking, social engineering and exploiting software vulnerabilities may be employed to gain access to target system.

**Maintaining Access** once access is gained, we attempt to maintain access to compromised system network. Bypassing security mechanisms, setting up backdoors or remote access tools and establishing persistency. The objective is to mimic the actions of a real attacker and assess the potential impact of successfull compromise.

**Covering Tracks**
In the final stage, the ethical hacker removes any traces of their activities from the target system or network. This includes deleting logs, modifying or removing files, and restoring the system to its original state. The goal is to ensure that our activity remains undetected
