Using github for finding API keys and/or other secrets might be very fruitful.
Use github search bar in order to find organisation or specific products and users. Then search deeper for most insecure looking repositories and then go to the section of:  
###### **Blame and History**
and then in it look for rigidly implemented API keys, encryption keys, secret, password. Use terms like: **key, secret, password**. Then if we find anythiing we can use tool called **KeyHacks** that is used for finding if those secrets leaked are valid. After that we should try to research how those keys work and how they're implemented. We should also look for config files to see more about infrastructure. You can also search for old unused endpoints, things that aren't covered with unit tests. Also old version of dependencies and non-updated libraries.

Tools used for automation of this process are:
