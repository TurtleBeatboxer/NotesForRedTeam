Used for bruteforcing web directories.
Dirbuster sounds the sweetst and has a GUI which makes it 100% better. Remember to use knowledge that you WROTE DOWN in order to make bruteforcing more easy (for example you can potentially know that site is written in php so there is no reason for looking for java related backend).

ViewPageSource: We look for any comments, information disclosures, account, secrets. As always. Password keys etc.

Remember that info disclosure is also valid feedback unlike in bug bounties
