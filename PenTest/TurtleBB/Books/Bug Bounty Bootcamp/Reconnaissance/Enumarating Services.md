It could possibly be passive and active form of reconnaissance depending on tools used.

Active form is just sending pockets to services in order to see which ports are responding and how and by that we can specify which services are running on which ports. Main tools for doing so are:
##### **Nmap, Masscan**

For the passive reconnaissance there are tools collecting data about running services all over internet using various techniques. Main examples of those tools are 
##### **Shodan.io, Censys, Project Sonar**
