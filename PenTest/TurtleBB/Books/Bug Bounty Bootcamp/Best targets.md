Best targets for bug bounting are always huge in user interactions. Thus means that we (as hackers) should attempt to look after social medias (user to user interactions), shops and anything that makes user interaction that involves another user. The less interactions provided to user, the more hard it will be for us to find anything. Kind of logical, but worth mentioning

Best: 
Social Media,
User to user Shops, (Allegro, OLX etc)
Reservation apps,
User to user bloggs,

Worst:
Informative pages,
Personal pages etc.
