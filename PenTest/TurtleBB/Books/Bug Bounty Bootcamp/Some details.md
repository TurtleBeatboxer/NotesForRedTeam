Always decode anything that you can find that looks encoded not necceserily hashed

**urlencoder.org** - can be used instead of burp suite decoder tool
**https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef** - CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

**SOP (Same Origin Policy)** - is used so that other webapps cant make curls to other webapps in same web browser. Site could potentially look through cookies and then use open webapp of for example bank account and make curls using it them.

Burp suite can be used to store curls in files.

Don't be afraid of cookies and messing with those, they are potentially missconfigured. Never ever think of developer as someone who uses best practices, so try even the stupidest shit you can imagine.

**Always remember to note
	**
	Note missconfgiruations that you find, note when something is broken, note strange behaviours and why is it strange
	**
	Note new functionalities that you find, small details that find and can be potentially useful in future
	**
	Try to follow what else can be tested and worth digging in
	**
	Always note a successful bug, because you might encounter something similar in near future. (Concept, potential risk, steps to reproduce, POC)
	**
	They should be clean from the start and till the end
