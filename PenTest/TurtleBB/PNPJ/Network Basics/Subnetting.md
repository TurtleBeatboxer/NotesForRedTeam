Zanim zagłębisz się w teorie wiedz, że to prostrsze niż myślisz. /x to ilość włączonych bitów. Bity nie włączone mogą być hostem. Od lewej włączasz bity. Ipv4 ma 32 bity. Tyle trzeba wiedzieć.
/31 to 1 bit możliwości 
/24 to 8 bitów możliwości
Na koniec trzeba odjąć dwa bo Network ID - first Address, Broadcast - Last Address 

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks called subnets. It allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and facilitates network management and routing. Subnetting is commonly used in IPv4 networks.

Subnetting involves borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address to create a subnet identifier. By doing this, a network can be divided into multiple subnets, each with its own range of IP addresses.

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation is a method used to represent IP addresses and their corresponding subnet masks. It specifies the network prefix length, which indicates the number of bits used for the network portion of the IP address. CIDR notation is expressed by appending a forward slash (/) followed by the prefix length to the IP address.

Here's an example to illustrate subnetting and CIDR notation:

Consider an IP address: 192.168.0.0/24

In this example, the IP address is in the format of "192.168.0.0" and the "/24" represents the prefix length, indicating that the first 24 bits represent the network portion of the IP address, while the remaining 8 bits represent the host portion.

With a /24 prefix length, the subnet mask for this network would be 255.255.255.0. This means that the first three octets are reserved for the network, and the last octet can be used for addressing hosts within the subnet.
