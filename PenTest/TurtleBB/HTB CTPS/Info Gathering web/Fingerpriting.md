Fingerprinting focuses on extracting technical details about the technologies powering a website or web application. Similar to how a fingerprint uniquely identifies a person, the digital signatures of web servers, operating systems, and software components can reveal critical information about a target's infrastructure and potential security weaknesses. This knowledge empowers attackers to tailor attacks and exploit vulnerabilities specific to the identified technologies.

Fingerprinting serves as a cornerstone of web reconnaissance for several reasons:

- `Targeted Attacks`: By knowing the specific technologies in use, attackers can focus their efforts on exploits and vulnerabilities that are known to affect those systems. This significantly increases the chances of a successful compromise.
- `Identifying Misconfigurations`: Fingerprinting can expose misconfigured or outdated software, default settings, or other weaknesses that might not be apparent through other reconnaissance methods.
- `Prioritising Targets`: When faced with multiple potential targets, fingerprinting helps prioritise efforts by identifying systems more likely to be vulnerable or hold valuable information.
- `Building a Comprehensive Profile`: Combining fingerprint data with other reconnaissance findings creates a holistic view of the target's infrastructure, aiding in understanding its overall security posture and potential attack vectors.

## Fingerprinting Techniques

There are several techniques used for web server and technology fingerprinting:

- `Banner Grabbing`: Banner grabbing involves analysing the banners presented by web servers and other services. These banners often reveal the server software, version numbers, and other details.
- `Analysing HTTP Headers`: HTTP headers transmitted with every web page request and response contain a wealth of information. The `Server` header typically discloses the web server software, while the `X-Powered-By` header might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks.
- `Probing for Specific Responses`: Sending specially crafted requests to the target can elicit unique responses that reveal specific technologies or versions. For example, certain error messages or behaviours are characteristic of particular web servers or software components.
- `Analysing Page Content`: A web page's content, including its structure, scripts, and other elements, can often provide clues about the underlying technologies. There may be a copyright header that indicates specific software being used, for example.

A variety of tools exist that automate the fingerprinting process, combining various techniques to identify web servers, operating systems, content management systems, and other technologies:

|Tool|Description|Features|
|---|---|---|
|`Wappalyzer`|Browser extension and online service for website technology profiling.|Identifies a wide range of web technologies, including CMSs, frameworks, analytics tools, and more.|

## Fingerprinting inlanefreight.com

Let's apply our fingerprinting knowledge to uncover the digital DNA of our purpose-built host, `inlanefreight.com`. We'll leverage both manual and automated techniques to gather information about its web server, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities.

### Banner Grabbing

Our first step is to gather information directly from the web server itself. We can do this using the `curl` command with the `-I` flag (or `--head`) to fetch only the HTTP headers, not the entire page content.

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ curl -I inlanefreight.com
```

The output will include the server banner, revealing the web server software and version number:

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ curl -I inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:07:44 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Location: https://inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

In this case, we see that `inlanefreight.com` is running on `Apache/2.4.41`, specifically the `Ubuntu` version. This information is our first clue, hinting at the underlying technology stack. It's also trying to redirect to `https://inlanefreight.com/` so grab those banners too

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ curl -I https://inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:12 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
Location: https://www.inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

We now get a really interesting header, the server is trying to redirect us again, but this time we see that it's `WordPress` that is doing the redirection to `https://www.inlanefreight.com/`

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:12:26 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/7>; rel="alternate"; type="application/json"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

A few more interesting headers, including an interesting path that contains `wp-json`. The `wp-` prefix is common to WordPress.

### Wafw00f

`Web Application Firewalls` (`WAFs`) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if `inlanefreight.com` employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

To detect the presence of a WAF, we'll use the `wafw00f` tool. To install `wafw00f`, you can use pip3:

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f
```

Once it's installed, pass the domain you want to check as an argument to the tool:

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ wafw00f inlanefreight.com

                ______
               /      \
              (  W00f! )
               \  ____/
               ,,    __            404 Hack Not Found
           |`-.__   / /                      __     __
           /"  _/  /_/                       \ \   / /
          *===*    /                          \ \_/ /  405 Not Allowed
         /     )__//                           \   /
    /|  /     /---`                        403 Forbidden
    \\/`   \ |                                 / _ \
    `\    /_\\_              502 Bad Gateway  / / \ \  500 Internal Error
      `_____``-`                             /_/   \_\

                        ~ WAFW00F : v2.2.0 ~
        The Web Application Firewall Fingerprinting Toolkit
    
[*] Checking https://inlanefreight.com
[+] The site https://inlanefreight.com is behind Wordfence (Defiant) WAF.
[~] Number of requests: 2
```

The `wafw00f` scan on `inlanefreight.com` reveals that the website is protected by the `Wordfence Web Application Firewall` (`WAF`), developed by Defiant.

This means the site has an additional security layer that could block or filter our reconnaissance attempts. In a real-world scenario, it would be crucial to keep this in mind as you proceed with further investigation, as you might need to adapt techniques to bypass or evade the WAF's detection mechanisms.

### Nikto

`Nikto` is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool, `Nikto's` fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.

`Nikto` is pre-installed on pwnbox, but if you need to install it, you can run the following commands:

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y perl
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ cd nikto/program
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ chmod +x ./nikto.pl
```

To scan `inlanefreight.com` using `Nikto`, only running the fingerprinting modules, execute the following command:

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```

The `-h` flag specifies the target host. The `-Tuning b` flag tells `Nikto` to only run the Software Identification modules.

`Nikto` will then initiate a series of tests, attempting to identify outdated software, insecure files or configurations, and other potential security risks.

  Fingerprinting

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
