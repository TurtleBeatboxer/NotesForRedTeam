There are two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).  
`TCP` is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.  
`UDP` utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. `UDP` is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. `UDP` is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with `TCP` and can significantly affect a real-time system. There are `65,535` `TCP` ports and `65,535` different `UDP` ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known `TCP` and `UDP` ports are listed below:
