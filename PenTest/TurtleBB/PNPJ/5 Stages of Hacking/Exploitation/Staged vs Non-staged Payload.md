Non-staged send entire exploit shellcode all at once. It is larger in size and won't always work due to firewalls. Example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

Staged payload is send in stages not all at once and due to that can be less stable. Example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Basically staged directory contains only system/shell meanwhile non-staged have more complicated directory, because it is made with multiple stages. Thats how you can remember it
