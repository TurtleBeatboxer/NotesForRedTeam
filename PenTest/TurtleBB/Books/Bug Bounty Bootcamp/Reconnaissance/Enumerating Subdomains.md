 After finding all domains one could use many tools that try to provide us all possible 2nd and 3rd level domains from get-go. 

### Tools used for searching for 2nd and 3rd level domains: 
#### **Sublist3r, SubBrute, Amass, Gobuster**

They tend to use different strategies such as bruteforce, DNS transfers and/or google dorking...
It is important to use every other one of them to get as many unique results as humanely possible and possibly getting rid of additional false-positives by getting informations that some subdomains listed by other tools are "dead".

Good wordlist for subdomain brute-forcingu:

Good tool for generating wordlist:

**command for deleting duplicates from wordlist:**
sort -u wordlist.txt wordlist2.txt

GoBuster is a good tool because it "learns" patterns from bruteforcing and therefore might be able to find even more things
