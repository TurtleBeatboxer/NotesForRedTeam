It is always best to first do reconnaissance before even attempting to start the page. Basic target validation is crucial, because we can actually sometimes fuck up and attack wrong person. (Someone fat fingered domain or something idk)

Reconnaissance is difference between finding zero to one bug to finding tons of them due to interconnected services. The more recon you sit with, the more accurate your reports will be. 

### **Manual Traversing through target.**
Makin account and clicking throughout app to learn more about its funcionalities. For facebook it will be making events, creating posts etc. For slack it will be creating teams, then making managers, admins and clicking throughout all functionalities. 

Those thing should provide enough knowledge to draw out surface of attack, so all possible points that could potentially be exploited.

### **Google Dorking**
Otherwise known as google hacking is powerful tool. I somehow described it several times across those obsidian vault, but I will try to do it one more time, but with even more informations.

You can google dork by using specific queries that provide very specific results and information back from google search tool.

**Those queries could be used as following:**
**site:python.org** - results will come back only from specific webpage

**inurl:"/course/jumpto.php"** - it look for urls specific to the String written down. If there is url like this the site might be vulnerable to [[TurtleBB/Dictionary/RCE]] 

**link:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS"** -it searches web pages for links that are addresses to this specific url

**filetype:log** - it searches for sites with specific extension of file. This one would search google for 
"{name}.logs"

**How to hack * using google**
Wildcard, otherwise known as * means that in this query we provided might be one character or several characters long in place of wildcard. In this example it would look for anything strting with How to hack and ending with using google

**"How to hack"**
Would be used to look for this specific sentence in google.

**"How to hack" site:(reddit.com | stackoverflow.com)**
this query would be used to find this specific sentence on either reddit.com or stackoverflow.com

**"How to hack" -php**
this query would be used to find this specific String on every page, but not those that have mentioned php.

**More examples:**
site:example.com inurl:app/kibana

site:s3.amazonaws.com example_brand

site:example.com ext:log

site:example.com ext:txt password

**It might be also worth mentioning** that instead of creating our own querries we could potentially reach for **google hacking database**
https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database

### **Always fucking look for the scope of the program**

Important tools for defining targets in scope:

#### **WHOIS**
- tool used for determinating who is behind the domain

#### **"https:/viewdns.info/reversewhois/"** 
- used to determinate domain behind data we provide it. Sometimes it can dig up very specific things that otherwise would be overlooked.

#### **nslookup** 
- tool used to find out ip begind domain

#### **IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO CHECK [[NETRANGE]] AFTER DOING WHOIS FOR IP**

Autonomous System Number can be used to tell if IP address is from the same "brand" (service, or something) as the other one.

To determinate ASN one could use the following command
whois -h whois.cymru.com {ip}

### **Parsing Certificate**
One could potentially use SSL to find and enumerate domains using it. 
Tools that do that for us:
#### **crt.sh, Censys, Cert Spotter**
Tools used as a way of enumerating sites through usage of SSLs field named Subject Alternative Name to find other possible hosts name that use same certificate.
