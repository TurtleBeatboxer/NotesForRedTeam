## Scan Network Range

  Host Discovery

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Target network range.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|

This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. We will take a closer look at these techniques in "`Firewall and IDS Evasion`".


```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

## Scan Single IP

Before we scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if it is alive or not. For this, we can use the same method as before.

  Host Discovery

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST

Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.18`|Performs defined scans against the target.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA host`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.|

If we disable port scan (`-sn`), Nmap automatically ping scan with `ICMP Echo Requests` (`-PE`). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an `ICMP reply` if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an `ARP ping` resulting in an `ARP reply`. We can confirm this with the "`--packet-trace`" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (`-PE`) for this.

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace

```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.18`|Performs defined scans against the target.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA host`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.|
|`-PE`|Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target.|
|`--packet-trace`|Shows all packets sent and received|

Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "`--reason`" option.

  Host Discovery

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:10 CEST

```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.18`|Performs defined scans against the target.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA host`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.|
|`-PE`|Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target.|
|`--reason`|Displays the reason for specific result.|

We see here that `Nmap` does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the `ARP request` and `ARP reply` alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired `ICMP echo requests`, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "`--disable-arp-ping`" option. Then we can scan our target again and look at the packets sent and received.

```shell-session
TurtleBB@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping

We have already mentioned in the "`Learning Process`," and at the beginning of this module, it is essential to pay attention to details. An `ICMP echo request` can help us determine if our target is alive and identify its system. More strategies about host discovery can be found at:
