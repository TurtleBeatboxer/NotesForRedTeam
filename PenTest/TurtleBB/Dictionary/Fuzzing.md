**Fuzzing** is the process of sending a wide range of invalid and unexpected data to an application and monitoring the application for exceptions. Sometimes hackers craft this invalid data for a specific purpose; other times, they generate it randomly or by using algorithms. In both cases, the goal is to induce unexpected behavior, like crashes, and then check if the error leads to an exploitable bug. Fuzzing is particularly useful for exposing bugs like memory leaks, control flow issues, and race conditions. For example, you can fuzz compiled binaries for vulnerabilities by using tools like the American Fuzzy Lop, or AFL (https://github.com/google/AFL/).

There are many kinds of fuzzing, each optimized for testing a specific type of issue in an application. Web application fuzzing is a technique that attempts to expose common web vulnerabilities, like injection issues, XSS, and authentication bypass.
