We can use for known CVEs when we know about technological stack/versions of tools and services used by target.
In http requests we can see headers like:
powered-by:
server:

Sometimes we can find fingerprints in the source html of webpage by searching for: powered by, built with, running. Sometimes there are also some directories which make the whole process easier:
/phpmyadmin - php
/robots.txt - php
/jinja2 -DJango and Jinja2

Tools that automate this process are following:
##### **Wappalyzer, BuiltWith, StackShare, Retire.js**
Wappalyzer collects frameworks, languages and 3rd party services on the website.
BuiltWith shows same things, but in less convenient more verbose way
StackShare is "social media" platform used to share technology stack of brands
RetireJS is tool for finding old libraries of JavaScript and packages of Node.js
