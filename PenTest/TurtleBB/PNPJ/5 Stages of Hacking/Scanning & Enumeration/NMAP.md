REMEMBER TO ALWAYS NOTE THINGS DOWN

If there is homepage that is the default one for the service it means they have poor cyber hygiene which probably means it will be easy. Remember that every banner that is thrown at you is information disclosure. For example internal information hostname can disclose their naming conventions or something.

Finding can also come from for example Nikto if the versions are very outdated
