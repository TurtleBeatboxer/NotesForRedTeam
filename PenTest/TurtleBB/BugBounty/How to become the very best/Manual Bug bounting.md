API enumaration and introspection.
More reverse engineering, more!

React is packed kind of code. Reverse engineering it can show you different environments and different API endpoints also Secrets, Credentials etc.

React code is very obfuscated. 
SourceMap -> SourceMap decompiler WebPack exploder
Electron Apps -> Asar
WebAssembly -> Wabt 
Hermes.js Hazam -> hbctool

Use LinkFinder to extract all JavaScript source code

Looking at GraphQL introspection querry into GraphQL explorer
OpenAPI
Apollo wrapper for graphQL which helps you by suggesting querries
GraphQL playground

if api is handcrafted  use documentation



For cloud enumaration:
letitgo Azure
recon.cloud  AWS
They recognize buckets etc.
Recognize buckets naming patterns.
Cloud roles might be missconfigured.

SaaS
Short Link services
Dangling Urls
CORS/PostMessage Missconfig

Use DevSecOps tools to pre-screen possible vulnerabilities
Static analysis:
As a hacker false positivies contextalization can give you valuable insight. If data is sanitazied? Is it transferred somewhere? Maybe transformed? What might be bad for developer might be best for hacker
->Semgrep
->CodeQL
->AppShark

Dynamic
->ClusterFuzzLite
->Jeales
->RESTler

When you first test application you open burp and test it out. But after a while you should extract all these endpoints and then you should codify that on into openAPI specification and maybe then pass it into automatic Scanner

Use CSR POC generator
Evil EPUB, PNG. Its better to write script to generate those payloads

Fuzzing, fuzzing and once again fuzzing
