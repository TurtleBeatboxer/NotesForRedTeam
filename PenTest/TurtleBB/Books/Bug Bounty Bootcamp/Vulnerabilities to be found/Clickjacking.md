It is an attack that is done by tricking user into clicking element that is hidden or is trying to look like another legit element from the website. It is done by layering html in order to hide on website in another one.

It is rarely in scope of bug bounty programs, because it requires wide user interaction with hackers elements. 
Attack is done by using ``<iframe> </iframe>`` attibute.
``<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="0" height="0"></iframe>``

######## I had to fucking comment this shit out, cause obsidian renders html, and it rendered I frame of the example.com


Websites use iframe in order to shot other websites banners in ads.
Sometimes iframes are there to place youtube video inside website.

In order to do clickjacking we would have to have our own website, that is overriding iframe with for example bank account transfer. If the victim is logged into his bank account the Iframe will be logged in too. Then we make iframe 0.00001% opacity in order for it to be as invisible as possible, and we place it via css over our actual website, so that when user tries to click button on our website he click transfer button on the website.

*I can tell why nobody likes or pays for clickjacking*

### **When is the website prune to clickjacking?**
First if it is vulnerable it has to have functionalities that change state of user, for example contact info. Secondly it has to allow to be in iframe by using X-Frame-Options: Allow.

By default it is enabled, but we can combat it by changing it to 'none' or 'self' etc.

### **How to look for it**
We have to look for catalogues on url that contain functionalities that change state of user and that we can fill inputs by using url. Then we have to take closer look at the response to our request for the site and it has to allow the usage of 
X-Frame-Options or they contain Content-Security-Policy. If the server doesn't use those to response it is probably allowed.

It is important that those website have to be only clickable in order to achieve change of user state, because taking away users keyboard input would be hard. Its clickjacking after all and not keyboardjacking or whaterva.

Sometimes clickjacking can be denied with simple patches like the fact that it can be served only inside same host. Then we can look for the way to place this Iframe inside another Iframe from the host so that it is validated that the second (last, more inside) Iframe is inside known-host website.

In clickjacking Escalation part is the most important, cause sometimes the only thing clickjackable is changing the websites theme to dark mode and sometimes it is possible to deactivate user account with one click. You never know

#### **Thins that help**
It is important to show scale of problem in order for clickjacking to be accounted as real vulnerability. It might be helpful to use:
**"Social-Engineer-Toolkit https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit"**
it is used for cloning famous websites in order for them to look more convincing. It is best to place iframe button so that is placed exactly over "we use cookies". People tend to never think twice about this button and it is so normal that nobody gives a thought to it before clicking it.
