When website uses http or url for redirect they might be prune to open redirect.

Websites have to redirect users many time. For example when users try to access settings without session they re redirected to login page and after logging in they're redirected back to the settings for the convenience of the user

Address URL as an tangible example of latter situation:
https://example.com/dashboard/login?redirect=https://example.com/settings

And if you read previous notes about XSS you know what is coming.
The following address can be used by a threat actor in order to redirect user to malicious website which my take away his data
https://example.com/dashboard/login?redirect=https://malicious.website.com/collect/data

Other examples might be open redirect based on refers. Referer is a header of HTTP that is included automatically by browsers. You can use them by for example creating website that redirects user to login page of something, and then the user will be redirected back to your page.

### **In order to combat open redirects** 
Validate queries provided by redirect parameter from url. It can validate them based on list of allowed hosts or something like that.

#### **How to find them?**
use proxy history to find keyword in requests looking something  like:
"redirect="
"redir="
"next=/"
"next="
You can look inside proxy history for 30X HTTP Parameters: 301, 300, 302, 303 etc.

You might also want to use google dorking. We can try to look for "=" sign using the following queries:
inurl:%3Dhttp site:example.com
inurl:%3D%2F site:example.com
or by using inurl parameter with following keywords:
*redir, redirect, redirecturi, redirect_uri, redirecturl, return, returnurl, relaystate, foward, forward_url, forwardurl, url, uri, dest, destionation, next,*

#### **How to avoid basic defense?**
Sometimes browsers use autocorrect so we might use some misspelled urls like:
https:attacker.com, https;attacker.com, https:/\/\attacker.com, https:\/\/attacker.com, https:\\example.com, httls://attacker.com\@example.com

Sometimes if the hostname is neccessary because of validator we can abuse that too. For examole:
https://example.com/login?redir=http://example.com.attacker.com
https://example.com/login?redir=http://attacker.com/example.com
https://example.com.attacker.com/example.com
https://example.com/login?redir=https://example.com@attacker.com/example.com

We can use addresses of URL data. They look like this: data:TYPE_OF_MEDIA[;base64],DATA
And we can use them like this:
data:text/plain,welcome!
https://example.com/login?redir=data:text/html;base64,PHNJcm1wdD5sb2NhGlvbj0iaHROcHM6Ly9wcnp5a2xhZC5jb20iPC9zY3JpcHQ+
and the base64 decoded version
<script>location="https://example.com"</script>

We can also double and triple encoding of our link. The interpretation should remain exactly the same (By a miracle)
To toy with validator we can do something like:
https://attacker.com%252f@example.com

Using other character than ascii to mess with validator. If validator and browser interprets those two in two different way we can try to abuse that, so that it gets validated but browser interprets it for our own purposes.
https://attacker.com%ff.example.com

You can also try and combine every technique into one huge, to some degree, polyglot:
https://example.com%252f@attacker.com/example.com.


#### **Why would anyone do something like this?**
Phishing. You could redirect user after logging in to your page where you alert him that you have to login one additional time, cause something went wrong. User will provide same password and voila, you will collect his data.

Sometimes url contains some valuable data like authentication tokens and/or oauth generated url to browse your account. If user gets redirected to attacker website, attacker can collect those tokens from referer header that is used for redirection purposes.
