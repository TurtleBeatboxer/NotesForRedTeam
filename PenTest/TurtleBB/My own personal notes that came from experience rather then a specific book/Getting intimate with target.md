If provided with enough time it might be also important to just get "intimate" with target, what I mean is that I as an threat actor should become just user for several days and use app like intended. Even without writing something down. Just use the site normally to learn about its most crucial aspects and functionalities that are less maintained then others. Accessing such endpoints and/or domains is the first thing I would write down if I had enough time to do the whole "getting intimate".
