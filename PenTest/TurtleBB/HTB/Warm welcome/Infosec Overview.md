# Infosec Overview

---

[Information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) (infosec) is a vast field. The field has grown and evolved greatly in the last few years. It offers many specializations, including but not limited to:

- Network and infrastructure security
- Application security
- Security testing
- Systems auditing
- Business continuity planning
- Digital forensics
- Incident detection and response

In a nutshell, infosec is the practice of protecting data from unauthorized access, changes, unlawful use, disruption, etc. Infosec professionals also take actions to reduce the overall impact of any such incident.

Data can be electronic or physical and tangible (e.g., design blueprints) or intangible (knowledge). A common phrase that will come up many times in our infosec career is protecting the "confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data," or the `CIA triad`.

## Risk Management Process

Data protection must focus on efficient yet effective policy implementation without negatively affecting an organization's business operations and productivity. To achieve this, organizations must follow a process called the `risk management process`. This process involves the following five steps:

|Step|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`Identifying the Risk`|Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.|
|`Analyze the Risk`|Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.|
|`Evaluate the Risk`|Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).|
|`Dealing with Risk`|Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.|
|`Monitoring Risk`|All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, `i.e., from low to medium or high impact`.|

As mentioned previously, the core tenet of infosec is information assurance, or maintaining the `CIA` of data and making sure that it is not compromised in any way, shape, or form when an incident occurs. An incident could be a natural disaster, system malfunction, or security incident.
